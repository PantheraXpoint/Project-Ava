# Custom Tracker Configuration
tracker:
  # Distance thresholds
  max_distance: 100.0          # Maximum distance for object matching
  min_distance: 5.0           # Minimum distance to consider as movement
  
  # Timeout settings
  max_disappeared: 30          # Maximum frames an object can be missing
  min_track_length: 5         # Minimum track length to keep
  
  # Confidence settings
  min_confidence: 0.3          # Minimum confidence for new tracks
  confidence_decay: 0.95      # Confidence decay factor for missing objects
  
  # IoU settings
  min_iou: 0.3                # Minimum IoU for overlap matching
  max_iou: 0.7                # Maximum IoU to consider as same object
  
  # Size constraints
  min_bbox_area: 100          # Minimum bounding box area
  max_bbox_area: 100000      # Maximum bounding box area
  
  # Movement constraints
  max_velocity: 100.0        # Maximum velocity (pixels per frame)
  velocity_smoothing: 0.3    # Velocity smoothing factor
