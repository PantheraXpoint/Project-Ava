    "question": "What happens in the second half of the game?\n(A) After switching sides, Liverpool capitalized on a defensive lapse by Arsenal. A midfielder intercepted the ball and played a through pass into the penalty area, where a forward calmly slotted the ball into the net, putting the Reds ahead. Trailing behind, Arsenal intensified their offensive efforts and successfully equalized. As the match entered its closing stages, Liverpool scored again. After a combination play on the right flank, a player found himself one-on-one with the goalkeeper. From a tight angle, his shot struck the inside of the far post and nestled into the back of the net, sealing the score at 2-1.\n(B) Shortly after the game resumed, Liverpool's midfield launched a swift attack. After a series of exquisite passes, the team's top striker headed the ball into the net inside the penalty area, establishing a valuable 1-0 lead for the team. As the game progressed, Arsenal intensified their offensive efforts, but Liverpool's defensive line remained solid. Towards the end of the match, Liverpool capitalized on another opportunity. A cross from the flank found another forward, who poked the ball into the goal from close range inside the six-yard box, securing a 2-0 victory.\n(C) In the second half, Liverpool displayed a more aggressive attacking stance, particularly showcasing greater organization and creativity in midfield. As the game progressed towards its final stages, Liverpool's offensive pressure gradually intensified, resulting in threats near the penalty area. One particular instance saw a free kick from Liverpool leading to an own goal by an Arsenal player in the penalty area. This goal laid the foundation for Liverpool's victory. Later in the game's dying moments, Liverpool once again scored another goal, resulting in a 2-0 victory.\n(D) In the second half, Arsenal displayed a more proactive and aggressive attacking approach, particularly in the midfield, where they demonstrated stronger organization and creativity, leading to the opening goal. However, as the match neared its final stages, Liverpool's attacking pressure steadily increased, resulting in threats around the penalty area. In one such instance, a Liverpool free kick led to an own goal by an Arsenal player inside the box, ultimately ending the game in a 1-1 draw.",
